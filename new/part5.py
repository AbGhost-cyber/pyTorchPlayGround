# In this implementation, `estimate_importance_weights` estimates the importance weight for each training sample by
# comparing the model's output on the training distribution with its output on the test distribution. We then normalize
# the weights to have a mean of 1.0. We use `WeightedRandomSampler` from PyTorch to sample the training data based on
# these weights during training. Finally, we evaluate the model on the test distribution after shift correction.
# You could try this on any dataset where you suspect the presence of covariate shift. However, for
# demonstration purposes,you can try this on a popular benchmark dataset such as MNIST or CIFAR-10.
# To artificially introduce covariate shift, you could modify the color distribution of the images in
# one of the datasets.For example, you could change the brightness or contrast of the images in the training
# dataset and keep the testing dataset as it is. This should lead to a difference in the pixel intensity marginal
# distributions between the training and testing sets, which is a common form of covariate shift.
